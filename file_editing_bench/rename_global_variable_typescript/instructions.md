# Task: Rename Global Variable

In the file `auth.ts`, rename the global variable `maxLoginAttempts` to `MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS`. This should follow TypeScript conventions for constant values.

The variable should be renamed consistently throughout the file, maintaining its functionality while following these specific requirements:
1. The variable declaration should be updated
2. All references to this variable within the AuthenticationService class should be updated
3. The reference in the exported getMaxAttempts function should be updated
4. The variable's value and scope should remain unchanged
5. No other code changes should be made
