# Rename Global Variable

In the file `auth.ts`, rename the global variable `maxLoginAttempts` to `MAX_AUTHENTICATION_ATTEMPTS`. The new name should follow the constant naming convention (uppercase with underscores) and be more descriptive of its purpose in the authentication system.

Make sure to update all occurrences of this variable throughout the file while maintaining the exact same functionality.
