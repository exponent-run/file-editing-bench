# Rename Global Variable

In the file `game_config.rb`, rename the global variable `$screen_res` to `$display_resolution`. This variable represents the screen resolution configuration for the game engine.

The variable should be renamed in all places where it is used, including:
- The initial declaration
- All references within the GameEngine module
- The runtime modification in the example usage section

Make sure to maintain the exact same functionality while only changing the variable name.
