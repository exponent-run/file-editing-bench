# Rename Argument Task

In the file `weather_processor.py`, there is a function `process_weather_data` that processes weather temperature readings. The first parameter `d` is not descriptive enough.

Rename the parameter `d` to `temperature_readings` to better reflect its purpose, and update all usages of this parameter within the function. The parameter represents a list of hourly temperature readings that are being analyzed for significant changes.

Make sure to update both the parameter name in the function definition and all occurrences where this parameter is used within the function body. Also ensure the docstring's Args section is updated to reflect the new parameter name.
