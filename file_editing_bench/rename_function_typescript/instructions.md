In the file `userService.ts`, there is a method named `p` in the `UserService` class that updates a user's preferences. Rename this method to `updateUserPreferences` to better reflect its purpose and follow the codebase's naming conventions.

The method should keep its exact same functionality and parameter types - only the method name should change.
