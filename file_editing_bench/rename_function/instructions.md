# Function Rename Benchmark

## Task Description

In the file `data_processor.py`, there is a function named `calc` that calculates the average of a list of numbers. This function name is not descriptive enough. Your task is to rename this function to `calculate_average` to better reflect its purpose, and update all references to this function throughout the codebase.

## Requirements

1. Rename the function `calc` to `calculate_average`
2. Update all references to this function in the codebase
3. Maintain the exact same functionality
4. Keep all other code unchanged
5. Preserve all docstrings and comments
6. Maintain the same indentation style

## Expected Changes

The function:
```python
def calc(numbers):
    """
    Calculates the average of a list of numbers.
    """
```

Should be renamed to:
```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    """
    Calculates the average of a list of numbers.
    """
```

And all calls to `calc()` should be updated to `calculate_average()`.

## Evaluation Criteria

Your solution will be evaluated on:
1. Correct renaming of the function
2. Successful update of all function references
3. Preservation of all other code and functionality
4. Maintaining code style and formatting
