# Variable Renaming Task

In the file `token_processor.ex`, several variables have unclear, abbreviated names that make the code harder to understand. Your task is to rename these variables to be more descriptive while maintaining the functionality. Make the following specific changes:

1. Rename `tkn` to `token`
2. Rename `dec` to `decoded_token`
3. Rename `val` to `token_parts`
4. Rename `p` to `payload`

Make sure to update all occurrences of these variables consistently throughout the file, including function parameters and pattern matching contexts.
