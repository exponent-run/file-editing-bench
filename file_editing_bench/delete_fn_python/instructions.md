# Delete Function Task

Edit the file `data_processor.py` to remove the `extract_domain` function and its corresponding import. Specifically:

1. Delete the function `extract_domain` completely
2. Remove the import statement `from urllib.parse import urlparse` since it's no longer needed
3. Keep all other functions and imports intact

The final file should maintain the same formatting and spacing as the original, just without the specified function and import.
