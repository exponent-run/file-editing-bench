# Delete Function Task

Your task is to modify the `data_processor.py` file by:
1. Removing the `fetch_remote_data` function completely
2. Removing the corresponding `requests` import since it's no longer needed

The rest of the file should remain exactly the same, maintaining all other functions and imports.
