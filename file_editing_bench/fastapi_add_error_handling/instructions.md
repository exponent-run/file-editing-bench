1. Edit the file `original_code.py` to add proper error handling to the FastAPI router with these exact changes:
   - Import HTTPException and status from fastapi
   - Import IntegrityError from sqlalchemy.exc
   - Add status_code=status.HTTP_201_CREATED to create_user decorator
   - Add try/except block in create_user to catch IntegrityError, do db.rollback() and raise HTTP 400 with message "User with this email or username already exists"
   - Add validation in get_users to raise HTTP 400 if skip < 0 or limit < 1 with message "Skip must be >= 0 and limit must be > 0"
   - Add validation in get_user to raise HTTP 404 if user is None with message "User with id {user_id} not found"
