In the file `data_processor.py`, there is a class named `X` that handles record management with functionality for adding records, retrieving records by timestamp, and clearing old records. Rename this class to `RecordManager` to better reflect its purpose and functionality.

The class should be renamed without changing any of its functionality or implementation details. Make sure to keep the exact same indentation and code style.
