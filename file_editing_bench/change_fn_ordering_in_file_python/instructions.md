# Function Reordering Task

Reorder the functions in `data_processor.py` to follow the logical flow of data processing. The functions should be ordered based on the sequence they would be called in a typical data processing pipeline:

1. First should be the data loading function
2. Then the data validation function
3. Then the data processing function
4. Then the data transformation function
5. Finally the results saving function

The content of each function should remain exactly the same - only their order in the file should change.
