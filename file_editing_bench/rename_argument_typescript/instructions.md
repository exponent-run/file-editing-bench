# Rename Argument Task

In the file `processUserData.ts`, there is a function `generateUserStatsSummary` that takes two parameters:
1. `stats: UserStats`
2. `d: number`

The parameter `d` is used throughout the function to represent the number of days to look back for the analysis. Rename this parameter from `d` to `lookbackDays` to make the code more readable and self-documenting.

Make sure to update all occurrences of this parameter within the function body as well.
