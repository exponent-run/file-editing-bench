# Rename Arguments Task

In the file `userAuthentication.ts`, there is a method `validateUserCredentials` in the `AuthenticationService` class that takes two parameters:
1. `p: UserCredentials`
2. `t: number`

These parameter names are not descriptive. Rename them as follows:
- Rename `p` to `credentials` since it represents the user credentials containing email and password
- Rename `t` to `tokenValidityMs` since it represents the duration in milliseconds for which the authentication token should remain valid

Make sure to update all occurrences of these parameters within the method body as well.
