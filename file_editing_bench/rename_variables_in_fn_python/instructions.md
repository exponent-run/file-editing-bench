# Variable Renaming Task

In the file `process_data.py`, rename the following variables inside the `analyze_server_metrics` function to be more descriptive:

1. Rename `lst` to `metrics_data` as it represents the input list of server metrics
2. Rename `tmp` to `batch` as it represents a batch of metrics being processed
3. Rename `v` to `batch_average` as it represents the average value of the current batch

Make sure to update all instances where these variables are used within the function. The function's logic and behavior should remain exactly the same.

Note: Do not rename other variables like `res`, `i`, `n`, or `x` - only rename the three variables specified above.
