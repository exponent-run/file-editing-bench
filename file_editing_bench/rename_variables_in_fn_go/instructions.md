# Rename Variables in Function

In the file `process_orders.go`, rename the following variables inside the `ProcessDailyOrders` function to be more descriptive:

1. Rename variable `t` to `totalRevenue` (it represents the running sum of order amounts)
2. Rename variable `n` to `orderCount` (it represents the count of orders processed)
3. Rename variable `f` to `completedOrders` (it represents the slice of completed orders)

Make sure to update all instances where these variables are used within the function.

The variables should be renamed exactly as specified above, maintaining the same types and functionality.
