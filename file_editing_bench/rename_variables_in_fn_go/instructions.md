# Variable Renaming Task

In the file `process_orders.go`, rename the following three variables inside the `ProcessDailyOrders` function to be more descriptive:

1. Rename the variable `t` to `totalRevenue`
2. Rename the variable `n` to `orderCount`
3. Rename the variable `f` to `completedOrders`

Make sure to update all instances where these variables are used within the function. The function signature and return statement should reflect these changes where applicable.
