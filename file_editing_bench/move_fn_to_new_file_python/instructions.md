# Move Function to New File

Your task is to move the `validate_transaction_dates` function from `data_processor.py` to a new file called `validation_utils.py` in the same directory. You need to:

1. Create a new file called `validation_utils.py`
2. Move the `validate_transaction_dates` function to this new file
3. Update the imports in `data_processor.py` to import the function from its new location
4. Keep all functionality exactly the same

The function should maintain its exact implementation and docstring in the new location. Make sure to include any necessary imports in the new file.
