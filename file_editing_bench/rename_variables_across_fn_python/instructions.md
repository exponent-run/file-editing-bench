# Variable Renaming Task

In the file `student_processor.py`, there are several non-descriptive variable names that need to be renamed to be more meaningful. Specifically:

1. The parameter `i` in the `calculate_grade` function should be renamed to `score` since it represents a student's numerical score
2. The variable `d` in `load_student_data`, `get_class_statistics`, and `calculate_passing_rate` functions should be renamed to `students` since it represents a list of student records
3. The variable `i` in all loop iterations (in `load_student_data`, `get_class_statistics`, and `calculate_passing_rate` functions) should be renamed to `student` since each iteration deals with a single student record

Make sure to rename all occurrences of these variables consistently throughout the file while preserving the functionality of the code.
