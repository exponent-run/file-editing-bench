# Rename Class Task

In the file `analytics.ts`, there is a class named `Proc` that processes and batches metrics before sending them to a database. The name `Proc` is not descriptive enough and should be renamed to `MetricBatchProcessor` to better reflect its purpose and functionality.

## Task

Rename the class `Proc` to `MetricBatchProcessor`. Make sure to:
1. Update the class declaration
2. Update the export statement at the bottom of the file

The functionality and implementation of the class should remain exactly the same.
