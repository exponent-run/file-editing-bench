# Rename Class Task

In the file `analytics.ts`, there is a class named `Proc` that handles time-series data point processing and storage. The name `Proc` is not descriptive enough and doesn't clearly indicate the class's purpose.

## Task

Rename this class to `TimeSeriesProcessor` to better reflect its role in managing and processing time-series data points. Make sure to update all references to this class name throughout the file.

The class should maintain exactly the same functionality, only the name should change.

The functionality and implementation of the class should remain exactly the same.
