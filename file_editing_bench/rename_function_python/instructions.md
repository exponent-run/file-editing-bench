# Function Rename Benchmark

## Task Description

In this benchmark, you need to rename a function to make it more descriptive and maintain all its usages across files. The function to be renamed is currently named `p` in the data processing module, which processes and standardizes data records. The function should be renamed to better reflect its purpose and functionality.

## Files to Modify

1. `task_files/data_processor.py`: Contains the function to be renamed
2. `task_files/main.py`: Contains usage of the function

## Required Changes

1. Rename the function `p` to `process_and_standardize_records` in `data_processor.py`
2. Update all imports and usages of this function in `main.py`

## Success Criteria

- The function name should be changed from `p` to `process_and_standardize_records`
- All functionality should remain exactly the same
- All imports and usages of the function should be updated to use the new name
- The docstring and type hints should remain unchanged
- No other functions or code should be modified

## Context

The function `p` is poorly named and doesn't convey its purpose. It processes a list of dictionary records by:
1. Filtering out empty records
2. Adding timestamps
3. Converting string values to uppercase

The new name `process_and_standardize_records` better describes what the function actually does.

## Notes

- Make sure to maintain the exact same functionality
- Preserve all type hints and docstrings
- Only rename the function and its usages, do not modify any other code
